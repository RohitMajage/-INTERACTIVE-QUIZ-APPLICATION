#HTML (index.html)
The HTML file structures the user interface of the quiz. The key elements in the file include:

A heading (<h1>) displaying the quiz title.
A container (<div class="quiz-container">) to hold the quiz elements.
A question section (<p id="question">) where the question appears.
A button container (<div id="answer-buttons">) to hold multiple answer choices.
A "Next" button (<button id="next-btn">) to move to the next question.
A score tracker (<p id="score">) to display the userâ€™s current score.
By using simple and clear HTML elements, the structure is easily readable and accessible.

Loads and displays questions dynamically from an array.
Handles user input (answer selection).
Provides real-time feedback by highlighting correct and incorrect answers.
